# Null Black Wallpaper
A black wallpaper for battery and performance tweakers!

Null Black Wallpaper saves your battery in two ways:

1. The best phone screens don't use energy to paint black pixels
2. This live wallpaper actually does nothing. Nothing is nothing, not "loading a black image". The background is blank, so your CPU can be doing other things, increasing your phone's performance and decreasing battery drain.
